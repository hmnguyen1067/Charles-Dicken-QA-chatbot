Davis considers Scrooge to be \"a protean figure always in process of reformation\"; Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who \"possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities\". Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption. Dickens\\'s biographer, Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\". Dickens\\'s attitudes towards organised religion were complex; he based his beliefs and principles on the New Testament. His statement that Marley \"had no bowels\" is a reference to the \"bowels of compassion\" mentioned in the First Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation.\\nOther writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a \"secular vision of this sacred holiday\". The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that A Christmas Carol shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friend John Forster as his \"Carol philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside\". From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge\\'s redemption underscores \"the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects\" of Dickens\\'s \"Carol philosophy\" of charity and altruism.\\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol in response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularly child poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle-class readership.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=15804, end_char_idx=18382, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n'), score=0.88904893), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='47f8bd50-9f28-4b2d-8e96-cca3eb13ea5c', embedding=None, metadata={'title': 'A Christmas Carol', 'gutenberg_id': 46, 'source': 'wikipedia', 'excerpt_keywords': \"A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens, literary criticism, The Illustrated London News, The Athenaeum, Fraser's Magazine, Tait's Edinburgh Magazine, John Ruskin, Margaret Oliphant, charitable themes\"}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d20b7466-bde9-4537-9f75-4fe8076ae449', node_type='4', metadata={'title': 'A Christmas Carol', 'gutenberg_id': 46, 'source': 'wikipedia'}, hash='51e7df426437562abc8015ebfcdf0c52d9a01e69f51edc2e4b07373cdd9e7b2e'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='458ff953-9b89-433a-b7b8-c103fd0edcd3', node_type='1', metadata={'title': 'A Christmas Carol', 'gutenberg_id': 46, 'source': 'wikipedia'}, hash='464d3a5d695d5b9c4a663e3a34205ffb1a5d8e221b8ca3b344360e7cdf9a62e0'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='be52b7e7-e1f1-4bd6-b1a9-31a68a03e05c', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='1bd8354a1cddff238e98f185d31aca8e38705e623e217d872013642df5947213')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='The Illustrated London News described how the story\\'s \"impressive eloquence ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour ... its gentle spirit of humanity\" all put the reader \"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author\".

The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1844, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale\\'s old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author\\'s sense of humour and pathos. The writer and social thinker John Ruskin told a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as \"mistletoe and pudding—neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds\".\\nThere were critics of the book.

In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. In the process, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as cards and Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London\\'s street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story or a Christian allegory.\\nPublished on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens\\'s small profits from the publication. He subsequently wrote four other Christmas stories. In 1849 he began public readings of the story, which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.\\nA Christmas Carol captured the zeitgeist of the early Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. Dickens acknowledged the influence of the modern Western observance of Christmas and later inspired several aspects of Christmas, including family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n\\nThe book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled \"staves\".', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2421, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n'), score=0.8795072)], metadata={'de4fdb7e-c2a1-40e5-9dc1-ef23a0900c1b': {'title': 'A Christmas Carol', 'gutenberg_id': 46, 'source': 'wikipedia', 'excerpt_keywords': 'Keywords: Scrooge, transformation, redemption, poverty, Want, Ignorance, TinyTim, ChristmasCarol, allegory, charity'}, '47f8bd50-9f28-4b2d-8e96-cca3eb13ea5c': {'title': 'A Christmas Carol', 'gutenberg_id': 46, 'source': 'wikipedia', 'excerpt_keywords': \"A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens, literary criticism, The Illustrated London News, The Athenaeum, Fraser's Magazine, Tait's Edinburgh Magazine, John Ruskin, Margaret Oliphant, charitable themes\"}, '765a26a1-7c89-46c0-91c7-c2826d1907e8': {'title': 'A Christmas Carol', 'gutenberg_id': 46, 'source': 'wikipedia', 'excerpt_keywords': 'Keywords: A Christmas Carol, Dickens, Ebenezer Scrooge, Jacob Marley, Ghosts of Christmas Past Present Yet to Come, Victorian Christmas, redemption, poverty, Field Lane Ragged School, John Leech'}})"
